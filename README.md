## SOC Defense Demo

This project includes a **SOC monitoring and defense demonstration** using Windows Defender and a custom SOC PowerShell monitor.  

- **Screenshots** show step-by-step detection:
  1. SOC monitor running
  2. Malware alert triggered
  3. Protection history confirmation
  4. Event Viewer logs
  5. SOC incident log  

- All screenshots are located in: `docs/screenshots/`  
- This demonstrates a **full attack → detection → defense → logging workflow**.
